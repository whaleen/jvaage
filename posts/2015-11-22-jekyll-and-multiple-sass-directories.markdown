I'd like to have `_sass` subdirectories in a default Jekyll site "watched".


Not possible as of this date: [https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/have-multiple-directories-for-my-sass-partials-possible/1261
](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/have-multiple-directories-for-my-sass-partials-possible/1261)

But, a solution in that discussion points to the use of Bower. I may try to achieve my goal with a Gulp rendition.

I suspect my destination in this travel through developing w/ Jekyll and SASS will lead me to building something akin to this: https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-jekyllized
