We have two branches locally. One is master, the other is gh-pages. We are developing on the master branch and using the gh-pages branch as our production ready branch.

After satisfied with commits to the master branch it's time to bring the gh-pages branch up to speed.

Switch to gh-pages branch

{% highlight bash %}
~ $ git checkout gh-pages
{% endhighlight %}

Rebase from master: Bring gh-pages up to speed with the master

{% highlight bash %}
~ $ git rebase master
{% endhighlight %}


Forget to switch back to master and made a whole slew of new changes to the project?

Switch back to master branch and rebase from gh-pages:

{% highlight bash %}
~ $ git checkout master
~ $ git rebase gh-pages
{% endhighlight %}

Best to always remember to switch back to master after updating gh-pages and deploying it to GitHub. If you have been pushing the gh-pages branch changes up while in a development mindset (forgetting you still have the gh-pages branch checked out) you'll have made a mistake. While intending to make your incremental progress known to others on what you thought was the master branch you have unwittingly goofing up the production branch gh-pages and not only that, that branch is is what your pages are being served from right now on the World Wide Web.



I've found the [following article](http://lea.verou.me/2011/10/easily-keep-gh-pages-in-sync-with-master/) helpful.
